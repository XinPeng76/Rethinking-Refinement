# Rethinking Refinement

This repository contains the official implementation for **Rethinking Refinement**, focusing on refinement mechanisms in generative modeling and continuous normalizing flows.

The codebase is **under active development**.  
The current version corresponds to an **initial research prototype** and has not yet been fully refactored or modularized.  
Future releases will focus on improving code organization, modularity, and readability, along with more detailed documentation and usage guidelines.

## 🔍 Overview

Refinement plays a critical role in modern generative models, particularly in flow-based and diffusion-based frameworks.  
This project aims to systematically re-examine refinement strategies and provide efficient and scalable implementations for research and experimentation.
