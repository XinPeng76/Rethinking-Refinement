# Rethinking Refinement

This repository contains the official implementation for **Rethinking Refinement**, focusing on refinement mechanisms in generative modeling and continuous normalizing flows.

The codebase is **under active development**, and a more detailed usage guide and documentation will be released soon.

---

## 🔍 Overview

Refinement plays a critical role in modern generative models, particularly in flow-based and diffusion-based frameworks.  
This project aims to systematically re-examine refinement strategies and provide efficient, scalable implementations for research and experimentation.
